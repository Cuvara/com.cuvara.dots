    /// <b>It exists because two writers to one component is the failure shape this workspace keeps
    /// paying for.</b> Once prediction owns the local player's per-frame position, prediction and
    /// this adapter would both write <c>LocalTransform</c> in the same frame — the adapter first, in
    /// initialization, prediction second, in simulation. That *works*, on every frame prediction
    /// runs, and fails only on the frames it does not: the avatar snaps back to the server position
    /// for one frame. Intermittent, visible only as feel, local player only, and it presents as a
    /// prediction bug. Splitting the value out gives each component exactly one writer.
    /// </para>
    /// <para>
    /// <b>Written for every replicated entity, not only predicted ones — and the reason is chunk
    /// layout, not tidiness.</b> Adding this only to predicted entities would give local and remote
    /// mirrors <i>different archetypes</i>. Two archetypes are two sets of chunks, and every query
    /// over mirror entities then iterates both, in a package whose entire justification is chunk
    /// iteration. That is a structural cost paid at query time by every system, to save one
    /// <see cref="float3"/> per entity. Uniform keeps one archetype and pays 12 bytes.

    /// <c>(x, y)</c> the wire actually carried, stored verbatim before
    /// <see cref="SnapshotSpaceMapping"/> touches it, and it is what a predictor wants — a predictor
    /// rewinds in the space it simulates in, and the shared simulation clamps against map bounds
    /// expressed in server coordinates. <c>LocalMovePredictor.Reconcile</c> takes a server-space

    /// <b>Why not invert the mapping instead.</b> <c>dot(p - Origin, Right)</c> is one line, and it
    /// was rejected: a float round trip through a projection is <b>not bit-exact</b>. The recovered
    /// value would differ in the last place, replay would integrate from a position the server never
    /// held, and the result is sub-ULP drift in the one system whose entire justification is
    /// bit-exactness — most likely diagnosed as FMA contraction, in a different package, by someone
    /// who never saw the inverse. Eight bytes per mirror entity removes the possibility rather than
    /// making it unlikely. It is also why <see cref="SnapshotSpaceMapping"/> still has no inverse:
    /// adding one would put the trap back within reach.
